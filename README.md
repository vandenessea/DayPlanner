# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project:

I needed boxes that could be sectioned off in 3 compartments.
I used tables from the bootstrap menu.
A button was added to each table.
A text area had to be added into the table for each time setting so we could put in our plans for each of the time slots.The class of "hourly" was used to pull specific times into the javascript so I could save the text in local storage with its corresponding times.
I had to use ids to capture the hours to be used in the click and save functions for each hour. An if/else statement was used to differentiate between the colors and past/present/future times.
A function for displaying time was also added in, with "let" being the javascript variable that is limited to the scope of a block statement.
